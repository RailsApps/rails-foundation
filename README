Rails + Foundation
========================
This is a fork of Daniel Kehoe's Rails App tutorial: https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-foundation/ with some modification
to display validation errors in the flash.

You can use this project as a starting point for a Rails web application. It requires Rails 4 and integrates Zurb Foundation.
